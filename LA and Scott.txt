Scott: LA, this is the inning you've been waiting for.

LA: it's easy to play Scott.
Scott: and you can play as often as you like.

LA: just put it on a tee already.

Scott: it says that every contestant wins a fan pack, but do you still get a fan pack if you win the jackpot?


Scott: did you see how bad the smog was today? you couldn't even see the hollywood sign
LA: no, it was pretty nice at the hotel... but the smog is pretty bad now. you still can't see the hollywood sign.(searching all over the horizon for hollywood sign)
Scott: that's because it's behind us on the other side of the stadium.

(scorekeeper indecision)
LA: it's a hit or an error, just make up your mind!
Scott: will a donut make you feel better?... it's your world, we're just living in it.

chopper to the pitcher
LA: it's just not carrying to the pitcher's mound tonight





x08-18-11
========

(Director of fun and games): How is Larry Andersen in Shane Victorino's fashion show, and you are not?
JJ: Well, Larry Andersen is Larry Andersen.

0:43
LA: He's gonna throw a ball this game. 
Scott: Somewhere along the way.
LA: It's gonna happen. I think.

+0:44
Scott: There's the first ball. Way to jinx him, Larry.
LA: Is it my fault?
Scott: So many things, Larry, _are_ your fault. We're not gonna put this one at your doorstep.
LA: The more I'm lookin' at it, the more I'm thinkin' it is my fault.

Scott: Did you hear what Nijer Morgan said? "Since there's nobody to really chase in our division, let's go chase Philly."
LA: He needs to put a button on it.

Scott: Mayberry now has 7 homers in 73 at-bats.
LA: That's even better than the Phanatic.
Scott: You're just saying that because he's here. 
LA: What a load.
Scott: He's starting to break headsets, and everything else. Oh my goodness, I don't think that table's going to hold you.
...
Scott: Wow, he really doesn't smell very good, does he? What was he doing in here?
LA: Well you are his favorite broadcaster, ya know?

JJ: You're not feeling a home run for David Herndon here, in the home run payoff inning?
LA: I gotta be honest, I'm not thinkin'.
JJ: After taking a look at that swing, I think you're right.
LA: As I said, I'm not thinking, which isn't far from the truth. But I'm thinking not, also, about David Herndon.
JJ: Swing and a miss, and Larry Herndon is exactly right. Haha, how 'bout that -- Larry Herndon.
LA: That swing was a lot like mine, wasn't it?

JJ: You and I are thinking alike. Scary for you.
LA: I think it's scarier for you.

Scott: What have you been doing for the last three hours [during the rain delay]?
LA: Drinking... coffee.
Scott: I didn't expect a second word out of you. Thought you were just gonna stop there in the middle.

LA: I can't write and listen at the same time.
Scott: Well, we all have our challenges in life, Larry.
LA: I have my share.
Scott: More than the average guy.

+2:12
Scott: Nobody's happier than Michael Stutes yesterday, seeing Michael Schwimer get called up to the big leagues. He no longer has to carry the pink backpack and long, feathered boa out to the bullpen.

+2:17
LA: Looks like Stutes picked off two people down there. Chris Young and Jeff Nelson, the umpire. Not sure that Bill Welke got that call right, looking at the replay.
Scott: Or Jeff Nelson? You just called him Jeff Nelson two seconds ago.
LA: Hey, I've had a tough paper route this week, okay?

+2:22
Scott: Sorry you have to hold a piece of paper, Larry.
LA: It's taxing!

+2:24
LA: Oh, boy. Better hit the censor button.
Scott: If you think we're turning that mic on, you've got to be kidding. I don't even think this is legal. Can Shane Victorino be on the air right now during a suspension?
LA: I think so. Ricky Bottalico did it once. See it's not that easy, Shane. How are you enjoying your time off?
Shane: It's awful. I'm miserable right now.
Scott: In general, you're kind of a low-energy guy, so I bet you can sit around and relax.
LA: I don't think you had a choice. I think they kicked you out of the clubhouse.
Scott: That centerfielder by the way, he's got it nailed down tonight.
Shane: He's actually pretty good. That's why I need to go talk to Ruben Amaro [about my contract extension]. Yeah go ahead Mayberry, hit another homer.

+2:26
Scott: It's never a good strategy to give Shane Victorino a live microphone.

+2:44
Scott: They just changed the hit to an error.
LA: Course they did, cuz I just put the hit in ink.


x08/17/11
========

Scott: What color would you call the lettering on the D-backs' uniforms?
LA: Ecru...
Scott: What?
LA: Ecru.
Scott: I dare you to spell it.
LA: E-C-R-U.
Scott: I thought that was an animal.
LA: It's another word for beige.

Scott: The official color of the D-backs' jersey lettering is Sonoran sand.
LA: Like Sonora Desert. Or is it the Sahara Desert?
Scott: I think it's a city.

+0:46
Scott: You've never been wrong, Larry.
LA: Well there was that one time when I thought I was wrong but I was actually right.

+1:02
Scott: The throw to first sails into the camera well on the side of the dugout.
LA: Nearly over the head of the Phanatic on top of the dugout.

+1:12
Scott: The Brewers are 31 games over .500 at home, and 10 games games under on the road.
LA: That smells of fishiness to me.

+1:59
Scott: The Phanatic has just milked a cow. And it's chocolate milk.
LA: Only the Phanatic can do that.

+2:00
Scott: When they asked you on the Daily News Live what the second best mascot is, you said, "The Phanatic." Did you misunderstand the question?
LA: Just settin' up the punch line.
Scott: Well when they asked you what the best mascot is, you said, "The Phanatic."
LA: That way, there's no close second.
Scott: I like how you backed yourself into a Phanatic compliment.

+2:03
Scott: Roberts has tattoos all up and down both arms.
LA: Likes the ink. That way he doesn't have to go out and buy fancy shirts.
Scott: Saves a few more for you.

+2:09
Scott: Do you know you have a peanut shell on your eyelid?
LA: No.
Scott: That's gotta hurt. The whole peanut shell-- what do you do-- 
LA: Pinched on my eyelids. Yeah, gotta pinch it.
Scott: Squeeze it open just a little bit. You gotta pinch your eyelid-- squeeze it open just a little bit, then release. That can't be good for your eyes.
LA: Salt's never good in your eyes.

+3:05
Scott: Just knowing you'd be here, that's pretty special.

========
(home run payoff inning)
jj: you're not feeling the home run with herndon batting?
LA: no, i just forgot to announce the contestant. wasn't thinking.
jj: they say that about you.


x08/19/11
========

(rain delay after 2 outs top 1st)
Scott: shortest outing of roy oswalt's career. he faces 0 hitters.

(michael morse raising his knee during warm-up swing)
Scott: he says it's a mechanism to help him remember to stay closed.
LA: well he's got a real short memory cuz he does it after every pitch.

(heavy-set todd coffey sprinting to mound from bullpen)
Scott: his jersey takes a beating when he comes sprinting in.
LA: so does the grass.


x08/20/11
========
(ryan howard w/ bases loaded in home run payoff inning)
Scott: if this contestant wins $10,000, he should have us over for steaks on his grill.
LA: i'll even bring my own steak.
Scott: do you have a bad grill?
LA: pretty much most of my life i've had a bad grill.

(sold out crowd at nationals park)
Scott: they must love that ian desmond bobble head doll giveaway.
LA: i think they just like the ian desmond bobble. they get it home, open it up, and the ball falls out of his hand.

LA: gotta be scared being in the box facing a hard thrower who's as wild as henry rodriguez.
Scott: i know you would be.
LA: i'm scared from here.

Scott: phillies fans greeting ryan zimmerman with lots of boos after last night's walk-off grand slam.
LA: and it's not like they're saying "zooo" because that doesn't have anything to do with zimmerman.

Scott: the entire internet is located right under my desk.


x08/21/11
========
(chien-ming wang's first pitch)
LA: his delivery alone is going to add about a half hour to the game.

Scott: with as slow as chien-ming wang is working, you don't even need a foul ball to take a station ID
LA: you can do it during his windup. this is ridiculous.
Scott: pretty sure you could read a book too.

(lightning and thunder)
LA: what we have here is a high-pressure system over the area, with the convection.
Scott: just throwin out weather words.
LA: having no clue what they mean.

LA: the phils took halladay out after the rain delay, and went with michael schwimmer for three innings. he did a great job after the first batter, and it was kinda like sink or schwimm... er.


x08/22/11
========
LA: his shirt looked like he just pulled it out of his wallet. i said, "what did you do, iron it with a rock?" and then he showed me his other shirt with ice cream all down the front. could you bring in one of gus's bibs tomorrow, please?
Scott: i'll see what i can do.

(phillies fans taking over nationals park)
Scott: he says, "we take it a little personal"
LA: maybe they should take it personal that they're under .500.
Scott: "hopefully we'll be taking over their stadium in the next couple years."
LA: yeah that's gonna happen. might just wanna wait on that comment.

jj: what's taking angel pagan so long to get out of the dugout?
LA: might be a washroom break.
jj: after grounding out on the first pitch, he spent more time getting to the plate than at the plate.

Scott: contreras threw in the bullpen and it didn't go well. his arm had some barkiness in it.

LA: the offense tonight came out like gangbusters in the 10-0 win.


x08-23-11
========
(earthquake)
LA: i thought it was just a gust of wind
Scott: i thought it was just gus
LA: i thought the nationals were playing a day game and todd coffey was running in from the bullpen.
LA: at the time, i was going for a bike ride and -- 
Scott: what??
LA: ... i thought it was either an earthquake or sarge was nearby snoring.

(john niese taking called third strike)
Scott: john niese didn't fool tim welke. he knew he wasn't up there to swing the bat.

LA: during an earthquake, you always want to stay above ground. that way you'll feel it less.
Scott: larry, at your age, staying above ground is always a good thing. not to mention the way you've treated yourself over the years.

xwheels: is john mayberry, jr. becoming more and more a part of your present and your future?
uncle cholly: how do you win a job? when you get to play, when you get to play, when you get to play, and you play real good... you'll force somebody to do sumthin where you get to play and you'll play regular.

xLA: nothing like kendrick giving himself an early birthday present of a W. go large.

x(LA sneeze)
xLA: it's easy to sneeze, Scott.
xScott: every selected kleenex wins a fun pack.

xLA: with that swing, howard was trying to make sure it wasn't going to be a single.

xLA: ruiz holds the glove right in the strike zone, but andy fletcher is too cool for school, won't give a reason for the call.

Scott: acosta has a ?? ERA, second-worst in the majors this month.
LA: second worst?
Scott: yup
LA: wow, somebody's strugglin.

(parnell closing out the 9th)
LA: he says he needs to start getting more mean. now's where he needs to get mean.
Scott: ball four, and he walks the leadoff man, which is not mean. it's rather gracious.

general thoughts:
uncle cholly calling ryan howard "howie"

off day

x08-26-11
========

Scott: got a gnat in my eye.
LA: thought sumthin was buggin' ya.

LA: citizens bank -- good banking should never take a day off. i should.

Scott: mckeon takes a slow walk out to the mound. i'm not sure if jack mckeon, at his age, has any other walk than slow.


x09-06-11
========
LA: every now and then, these umpires should watch the game.

LA: 9 balls and 8 strikes so far for stutes.
Scott: not an enviable place to be if you're michael stutes.


x09-07-11
========
Scott: McCann called time and motioned for Beachy to come over.
LA: McCann was just sayin', "Hey, I'm the veteran here. You come to me if you wanna talk."
Scott: That's probably not what he was saying.

Scott: The umpires are operating on their discression, and their judgment.
LA: Not that that's a good thing.

Scott: Well, they got the call right. Maybe they maybe didn't get there the right way.

Scott: Dan Uggla stole the Phanatic's four-wheeler before the game. He then threw the key in the Braves dugout.

LA: One thing you don't wanna do is get into a battle with the Braves bullpen, which has been very stingy.


x09-08-11
========
John Brazer: The last time SpongeBob SquarePants was here, he fell out of the back of the Phanatic four-wheeler.

LA: I don't think his eyesight's real good if he thinks that was foul.
Scott: Couldn't see it. It's too dark.

LA: They say the ball travels best with the roof closed.
Scott: What about the panels? What does that do?
LA: They-- they block the side view.
Scott: You'd think having them open would allow wind to knock balls down, but I'm no physicist.
LA: You're not even a physician!

Scott: Either something good just happened in the Packers game, or the fans thought it was a really special 1-1 changeup.
LA: They love the changeup here in Milwaukee!

(+1:33)
Scott: Phillies nothing and the Brewers nothing, but that's all about to change, since Larry's now standing up.

LA: Narvison's only complete game in his career is none.

Scott: Gus likes turkey dogs.

LA: You pretty much have to take Nyjer Morgan with a grain of salt.

Scott: My white out is out. You never want your school supplies to go bad on the first day of a roadtrip.

LA: With his next contract, Fielder might get some big glue. Might go from Prince to a king.

LA: I don't know how that ball stands it.


x09-09-11
========
Wheels: Your club is the best in the National League scoring runs with two outs. How much can that demoralize another team?
Uncle Cholly: The information you get nowaways, you got all these stats and things like that, the other team knows that with two outs the inning isn't over yet.

Scott: Shawn Marcum throws a heater, or as he calls it, a warmer, because it only reaches the upper 80s.

Scott: It's not exactly worth it to slow down a guy with 18 steals (Victorino). It's not like they got Maury Wills out there.

Scott: Fans are waiving their tony plush(?) rally towels, which represent what nijer morgan calls his alter ego. Some might just call it his ego.
LA: Some might just say the big ego.

LA: Maybe it's brighter than we think. I know _I'm_ not, but _it_ may be.

LA: Every squirrel finds a nut now and then.

Scott: The only run off Halladay in eight innings was Corey Hart, who didn't even touch the plate.

Scott: I love slides.

LA: You must be part cheese-head.


x09-10-11
========
Scott: The Phils' running game has been pretty-well stalled.

Scott: They might have the tallest hot dog vendor in the league here.

LA: You said lime green stripes.
Scott: No, I said peppermint stripes.
LA: Oh, I was thinkin' of the lime peppermint.

Scott: We'll see J.A. Happ on Tuesday.
LA: That's what it says there, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Somebody told me we're not gonna see Happ.
Scott: I'm pretty sure that was me.
LA: Oh. I knew somebody told me that! Why'd you lie to me?

LA: Guess Corey Hart decided to take a pitch with one strike.
Scott: Not sure what kind of strategy that would be.

LA: Cliff Lee is talking to Ted Tichenor with his head down.
Scott: Or Todd Tichenor. You said Ted Tichenor.
LA: Who's he?
Scott: Maybe his brother.
LA: His friends call him Ted.

Scott: Harry Wright, inventor of cut-off pants, said, "You couldn't play ball well with inches of flannel flapping around your ankles."

Scott: I never know what they're saying on the press announcements. From our spot in the booth, they sound like Charlie Brown's parents.

LA: Kinda funny to see a .200 hitter (Carlos Gomez) going through all those gyrations at first base after getting a hit. Sometimes you wanna act like you've been there before.

LA: Todd Tichenor is just really, really, really not good. At all.

LA: A lot of people have trouble saying my name.
Scott: The Larry part or the Andersen part?

Scott: I don't know why Charlie chose to use Pete Orr, but he probably has more than we know in his--
LA: Bag of tricks?
Scott: In his information Rolodex.


x09-11-11
========
Uncle Cholly: Baseball's popular, I think, and things like that.

Scott: Every selected contestant wins a fan pack.
LA: It's easy to play, but I'm not sure if it's easy enough for umpires to play.
Scott: Well you do have to LOOK in the Daily News to find the entry coupon.

Scott: Ricky Weeks is the first player to not nearly fall down for the Brewers this week on a pitch inside.

LA: Our bus made a stop at a convenience store in the middle of Tennessee. I asked where the adult beverages were.

LA: I have that trusting-looking face.


x09-12-11
========
LA: It's an awful lot like sedona red.
Scott: It would be terribly confusing for Juan Samuel to deal with when selecting shoes.

Scott: It's a crowded dugout and bullpen.
LA: More like a traveling football team.

Scott: Because this broadcast is all about accuracy, we're going to make an in-game change in the pronunciation of Jimmy Paredes.

Scott: When you've lost 97 games, there's not a whole lot of room for being flashy.

LA: Does it look to you like Brett Myers has kinda taken to burritos here in Houston?
Scott: Well, he was always been a fairly big cat.
LA: He was always fairly big, but he looks fat. Or maybe it's just his uniform's blousy.
Scott: I can't believe you just called him fat.

LA: I couldn't find the new press box. I ended up in the kitchen.

LA: Kinda surprised I wasn't right next to Nolan Ryan in the Astros mural.


x09-13-11
========
Scott: Francisco is in his sixth start since July 3, but his third start on this road trip. Might want to think about giving him a breather.
LA: Give him a rest! Easy!

LA: This is a dinky strike zone.

LA: I'm waiting for the time an umpire finally goes, "Ball, I missed it."
Scott: I hope you don't hold your breath Larry. Every now and then you say something amusing. Gotta keep that around.

LA: Charlie's not gonna be happy after the ground ball that Martinez threw to Polanco.
Scott: That play falls in the "sloppy" category he mentioned last night.

Scott: Ball four, somewhere. J.A. Happ can't believe it, Quintero can't believe it, I don't even think Polanco can believe it.
LA: It's unbelievable!
...
Scott: I just think it's a situation where neither batter, pitcher, catcher, nobody knows what a strike is, exactly. Broadcaster...

Scott: They're goading you: who are the three best umpires in baseball?
LA: There aren't three. There's about forty of them that tie for last.
Scott: I can think of one name on this umpire list that will ilicit a positive response out of you.

Scott: The hand-operated scoreboard in centerfield has a better Internet connection than me. Just for that, I'm not gonna read any more scores. They're probably wrong.


x09-14-11
========
LA: Are Jose Altuve's socks longer than his pants?

(+1:28)
Scott: Bud Norris was definitely upset with that pitch coming up and in from Halladay.
LA: Oh well.

LA: Chooch just tried to flip the ball into the stands but threw it into the screen.
Scott: Threw himself a souvenir.


x09-15-11 (game 1)
=================
(+0:24)
Uncle Cholly: If you don't-- if you don't like to play here, then sumthin's wrong with ya. I can play baseball here, any day, with nobody in the stands, believe me, cuz it's just Citizens Bank Park. It has a feel about it. If you put fans in the stands, and the energy, and everything that goes on, then if you don't wanna play here, then ya know, like uh, you might wanna go check yourself in the mirror.
...
JJ: Skipper is spunky today.

Scott: We're getting a light bit of light rain falling now at the ballpark.
LA: It's just a mist.
Scott: I'm not allowed to call that a light rain?
LA: No.
Scott: Then that guy's not allowed to use his umbrella.
LA: It's a moderate mist.
Scott: He's got headphones on, too. He might be listening.
LA: Think he is? Hey you with the green and white umbrella, are you listenin'?!
Scott: I think he might be. He IS listening! Is it really raining? He says it is!

Scott: Is everybody allowed to use their umbrellas now, Larry?
LA: Yes, cuz it's-- yes, now it's heavier.
Scott: Heavy mist or an actual rain?
LA: It's a rain. Yup, umbrella fan says it's rainin'.

Scott: Come out early on Saturday for German Heritage Night. There will be a beer garden tent from 5 to 7. I bet Larry will be there
LA: I'm German!
Scott: It's beer!

(stopped at +2:10)

(+3:12)
LA: I think Hurricane Irene's sister showed up today.


x09-15-11 (game 2)
=================
Wheels: What makes Cliff Lee so effective?
Uncle Cholly: His command and also how he controls the game... He don't waste around... He becomes a four-pitch pitcher with-- who can throw strikes and steady command and just, uh, strike zone put the ball where he wants to.

LA: First time I batted, I went to the plate with my jacket. The umpires laughed. When I looked down, I went, "Aw, man."

LA: Those batter's boxes are not big enough for me. I couldn't get far enough away from the plate.


x09-16-11
========
Scott: Get into the swing with the home run payoff from the Daily News.
LA: And Scott, did you know it's really easy to play?
Scott: I was somewhat aware of that fact, Larry.

Scott: We're just talking on the air about stuff that matters not to those at home.
LA: But it matters to you and that's important to all of us.

LA: "Watch the playoffs on Fox and TBS... Legends are born in October." 
Scott: You bet they are.
LA: Is that when you were born?
Scott: Nope.
LA: Well, not all legends are born in October then.
Scott: No, but some are.

LA: It was a line drive, but it was like a semi-line-drive.
Scott: What do you mean by semi-line-drive?
LA: I don't think it was smoked like on the barrel of the bat.
Scott: It had a little hump in the line?
LA: Yeah, a humping line drive.
Scott: You and the humping line drive and the invisimist.

(Albert Pujols thrown out running first to third)
Scott: If Pujols is going to start running, he should try home to first. Just as a way of getting warmed up.
LA: Baby steps.

JJ: Pujols has so much power that if you had the option of surrendering three singles to him instead of challenging him, you just might take it.
LA: Like a moral victory.

JJ: My iPad app is frozen.
LA: Shocker.

Scott: All my electrical tape is gone. You used it to tape up your charging cord.

Scott: Celebrate German Heritage Night tomorrow at the ballpark. A German heritage beer garden tent will be open from 5 to 7.
LA: You might see a broadcaster there!
Scott: Herr Anderson will be there!

Scott: Furcal slugs a bunt to shallow left.

Scott: Lefty Marc Rzepczynski warming up in the bullpen.
LA: I knew who it was, I just didn't want to have to try and say it.

(+2:25)
LA: We go to the bottom of the seventh, with this tie scored at one.

(+3:10)
Scott: And the pitch... Berkman takes, just outside.
LA: I don't think so.

(+3:20)
Scott: If they were any deeper in the outfield for Howard, they would need a ticket.

(LA doing some kind of sunflower seed "trick")
LA: you've made me resort to this, rally seeds.

(down 2-0, bottom 6th)
LA: this is the inning of change. it's gonna happen right now. it's gonna be a bust out.

Scott: i'm referring to the sunflower seeds on the very tip of your nose.
LA: those are the toughest.
Scott: have you ever counted the most amount of seeds on your seeds on your face?
LA: i think 87.
Scott: how long does it take to get 87 seeds on your face?
LA: about 6 innings.
Scott: i assume it was a game in which you were not playing.
LA: i just did it, whenever i did it.

LA: espinosa is now 7 for 9 off cliff lee with 3 home runs. time to buzz a tower.
Scott: time to take the sunflower seeds off your face.
LA: guess it's not working, huh?


x09-21-11
========
LA: Get your gear straight from the source: Phillies.com shop.
Scott: "Shop" the Phillies.com shop... It just says "Phillies.com shop"?
LA: There's no exclamation point after "shop," so you don't have to shop, but if you're gonna get your Phillies gear, get it at the Phillies.com shop.
Scott: There's no exclamation point?
LA: Nope. It's not mandatory.
Scott: Well an exclamation point wouldn't make it mandatory. It would make it exciting!
LA: It is exciting.
Scott: It would make it exclamatory. Is that even a word?
LA: Ask sarge. He knows. It's not a word.
Scott: Teacher says it is.
LA: Exclamatory? I'm not takin my kids to his school.
Scott: Joe Gains has looked it up. It is an actual word.
LA: Could I have the origin ("or-IH-jin"), please? Could you use it in a sentence?
Scott: It's irrefragable. Irrefragable, Larry.

LA: what'd you do with my white out?
Scott: I did nothing to your white out
LA: you hid it, i found it.
Scott: Tried to white out your white out. Hide out your white out.

LA: Is this the inning I've been waiting for?
Scott: Indeed it is. It's the home run payoff inning.
LA: You read my mind.
Scott: It's an open book, larry.
LA: It's my mouth.

Scott: tomorrow night's matchup is roy oswalt vs. brad peacock.
LA: tell me all you know about brad peacock.
Scott: i just did.
LA: gotta be a colorful guy.

Scott: Phils now down 7-5 in the 9th, and within a bloop and a blast of tying it up.

x09-24-11 (game 1)
=================
Scott: Ruben Tejada's drag bunt "sacrifice" is scored 2-3.
LA: Sacrifice my foot. That's just-- that's just-- not a sacrifice.
Scott: Pretty sure the intent there was to get a base hit. Nevertheless..
LA: Nevertheless.

LA: Hirschbeck's wrong. No surprise there.

LA: I was going to yell at Hirschbeck just for Hamels. People helping people.
Scott: I'm sure he appreciates it. The sentiment anyway.

(+2:14)
LA: They put rules in place just to break 'em. Laws are made to be broken, Scott.


x09-24-11 (game 2)
=================
Scott: It's the fifth inning in New York.
LA: Is this the inning I've been waiting for?
Scott: No, it's the inning after the inning you've been waiting for. The home run payoff inning was the fourth. No more funny business.

Scott: Pop-up to the mound and Stutes is gonna take it himself.
LA: Great athlete.
Scott: He is from Oregon.


x09-25-11
========
Scott: Pence hits a line drive 2-run homer!
LA: Take that!

Scott: Legends are born in October. Larry was born in May.
LA: Never wanted to be a legend anyway.

Scott: And now, for all of us in the booth -- Joe Gaines and Larry Andersen, the "Flushing Noodle," -- here's the post-game show with Jim Jackson.


x09-26-11
========
(2:48)
LA: my wireless internet is broke and i don't know how to fix it.
Scott: john kramer can probably fix it. he can fly airplanes. (bottom 7?)

Scott: They just announced the Turner Field crowd at over 42,000.
LA: Not sure where they're at.

LA: I don't know how many strikes C.B. Bucknor missed so far, but it's more than a few.

Scott: Do you think Marty Brennaman spent the afternoon at the Flushing Noodle, eating Chinese food?
LA: No.

Scott: Do you know the all-time winningest pitcher from Panama?
LA: Yeah, but I can't think of his name.
Scott: He's that guy, who had all the wins, and he was from Panama.
LA: Yeah, that guy. the right-hander. The Panamanian.
Scott: The Panamanian right-hander!
LA: You remember him.
Scott: He's also the all-time saves leader in the majors
LA: That would be Mariano Duncan... I mean, Mariano Rivera.
Scott: Dunky!

(1:41)
(Howard unable to score from second on a single)
Scott: I can't think of another player on this roster who wouldn't have scored.
LA: There's not.
Scott: Is there another one in the league? It's been a struggle.
LA: It's not that he's not trying. He's just slower than molasses.
Scott: We saw him in New York the other day clog up some bases.
LA: Big time.

(1:53)
LA: Martin Prado makes the catch and he just crushes into the wall and falls back onto his backside. He actually does a reverse tumblesauce.
Scott: A tumblesauce?
LA: Or, somersault, as most people call it. In South Philly, it's tumblesauce.

(1:59)
Scott: The drill won for the first time here in the tool race at Turner Field.
LA: That's a bit of bad news.

(2:01)
Scott: It's not that Alex Gonzalez didn't think it was a strike when he was arguing, it's that he didn't think it was a strike a minute ago.
LA: There's always that problem.


x09-27-11
========
Scott: Swing and a miss, struck him out, and Uggla drop-kicks the bat.

LA: There's just a lot of false information out there. It's all about accuracy in this broadcast.

Scott: Talk about a slow-developing play.
LA: Mercy.
Scott: Chipper Jones with a bum knee chasing a slow roller, and Howard with his bad heel chasing... first base.


x09-28-11
========
LA: That's the third straight pitch that could have been called a strike.
Scott: It was down and in.
LA: You're not a pitcher!

LA: Looked like Raul saw it, wanted to swing and then didn't want to but then it was too late to not to want to.
Scott: What?

Scott: Did I just hear what I thought I heard?

9:00pm, top 7
Scott: We set a new personal record. three different engineers in the studio in three days!
LA: Some people said they just didn't think it could be done.
Scott: We showed 'em

LA: The Braves even have kids in the stands crying. Sobbing!

Scott: Think they're banging cow bells in St. Pete after a six-run eighth?
LA: If they have anybody there.

Scott: Prado's wild hack looked like a swing through deep water.

11:24pm
Scott: You have to walk the dog in the morning.
LA: Door's open... I gotta winterize the pool tomorrow.
Scott: Big day.

11:26pm
Scott: Schneider stopped briefly before sprinting to third.
LA: He's like, "I can't go first to third -- oh yes i can!"

Scott: Dan Uggla held up on the check swing, says Jerry Meals. And we all know where his allegiances lie... just kidding.


x10-01-11
========
Scott: Get into the swing with the home run playoff payoff with the Daily News.
LA: And it's easy to playoff play.

(After Lance Berkman hits a first-inning, three-run home run)
LA: Can I change the "What it will take to win the game," because they're not going to be able to score first anymore.
Scott: Sure.
LA: Phils will need at four runs or better.

LA: Well Lohse will not no-hit the Phils... How bout that?
Scott: Step out on that limb Larry.

Scott: Boy they play David Freese way in at third base for Victorino.
LA: They must not have advance scouts in St. Louis.

LA: Pujols doesn't run unless he has a chance for a hit. I'll tell you that right now.

LA: Is something going on with the baseball so that when it gets to the Phils' bats it doesn't square up?

LA: Halladay's gonna win comeback player of the game.

Scott: Didn't feel like doing your game summary?
LA: No, I'll let the crack of the bat do the talkin' for me.

LA: The other thing is tryin to get guys that aren't used to doin sumthin to try and do sumthin that they're not used to. Did I just say that?
Scott: Something like that.

Scott: Get out of the way Phanatic! Save yourself!


x10-02-11
========
(+0:43)
Scott: Every selected contestant wins a Phillies fun pack.
LA: And it's not that tough to play in the playoffs, either.

LA: Tom McCarthy did a nice job there blowing that ball foul with his hands, from the booth.
Scott: Long arms.

LA: Nothing wrong with a good tingle now and then.

Scott: The rain's coming down a little bit harder now. Are we allowed to officially call it a light rain?
LA: Yeah. Or a heavy mist, either one.


x10-04-11
========
LA: I can't write on my scoresheet, because everything's so scribbley.

Scott: Just another ho-hum playoff game.
LA: I'll be back to the cardiologist in no time.

LA: Carlos is gonna have to turn it up a notch. I think he swung when Molina was throwing it back to the pitcher.
Scott: Madson's gonna get a crack at him.
LA: Better start swinging now.


x10-05-11
========
Uncle Cholly: I rolled the marbles putting Madson out there in the eighth. I was Virginia State Marble Champion at one time.

LA: It's a travesty to have to play with these shadows.
...
LA: Well, maybe we should play with shadows all the time.

LA: I thought I was kinda out of the loop. Got the window closed! Felt like I was just here talkin' to myself!
Scott: He's got the window closed in front of him. At least we know the cleaning crew is doing their job.

LA: Victorino got up and threw it from the middle of the warning track, and threw it back to the wall. I don't know how he did that but that's what he did.

Scott: Rollins has 20 hits in his last 39 at-bats.
LA: En fuego.

LA: Their outfielders play like cornerbacks and safeties when a team's up by a touchdown late in the game.
