Scott: If you're scoring at home, that was scored an error all the way. It's all about accuracy, Larry.
LA: Yes, it is.
Scott: He's not scoring in the booth, so you should be scoring at home.
LA: I was trying to figure out if I sneezed or not.

Scott: The Phanatic is here for spring training opening day. The information I have from the Phanatic's best friend is that he will also be here for St. Patrick's Day. Shocker.
LA: Hard to believe. That Phanatic can pick 'em.

LA: I don't wanna say Papelbon is goofy in a bad way. A little goofy in a good way.
Scott: Goofy in a closer kind of way.

LA: I just figured out what you said. And I thought it was something else.
Scott: Do I want to know what it was? On the air or off?
LA: I thought you said DUIs, and you looked at me. I'm like, why are you looking at me?
Scott: No, D. Wise, as in Dewayne Wise.

Scott: Scott Podsednik is from West Texas, which is not in west Texas. It's actually in north-central Texas.
LA: That makes a lot of sense. It's like me saying I'm from the South. South Seattle... Just move it to the west.
Scott: You can't just move a town.
LA: You guys are in the wrong place. Move!

LA: I found out that most accidents happen within 25 miles of your home, so I moved 30 miles away.

Scott: You alright?
LA: Yeah, I might be alright. Just trying to find my eye.

LA: I've turned over a new leaf. Love those umpires!

LA: These umpires just don't get enough credit.

LA: Thanks to baseball, I figured out a whole bunch of different ways to spell holiday.
Scott: Bryan Holaday doesn't spell it like having or celebrating a holiday. He doesn't spell it like Matt Holliday.
LA: Or like Roy Halladay.

LA: Wyoming is not known as a big baseball state.

LA: Probably. I just don't remember.
Scott: Caught in that steel trap that is--
LA: Rusted, complete.

Scott: On the same webpage that lists player births by state, it lists players born in foreign countries and U.S. territories. It also lists one player as being born in the Atlantic Ocean. Ed Poray, who played three games in 1914.
LA: So what is his citizenship? He would have been a good waterboy.
Scott: Born in 1888 in "Atlantic Ocean."
(Editor's note: Edmund Joseph Porray was, in fact, born at sea. He pitched 10-1/3 innings  for the Buffalo Buffeds of the Federal League.)

LA: Back to the paper.
Scott: Larry was trying an automated scorebook on his favorite mobile device, which quickly became his not-so-favorite mobile device.
LA: I got through an inning and a half with it.

LA: Do you know what it would look like if I switched from the automated scorebook to paper? I wouldn't know who did what.
Scott: How is that different from any other game?
LA: Good point!

Scott: Last year, Justin Wilson had 67 walks in 124.1 innings.
LA: That's just plain and simple ridiculous. I just for the life of me can't understand how guys who can't throw strikes get to big league camp. Any idea?
Scott: They drove. Pretty sure he didn't walk.
LA: He's got enough walks in him.

Scott: It's not over til it's over, Larry.
LA: That's exactly right.
Scott: Don't pack up your automated scorebook til it's over.
LA: Oh, that part's over.

LA: Tuffy's gonna get a run home. Just lettin' ya know, so that you're not surprised when it happens.
Scott: Are you making a call?
LA: I didn't say he's getting three runs home, just getting a run home. If he gets something to hit.
Scott: All these qualifiers.
LA: Yeah, kinda takes a little bit away from it, doesn't it?

LA: I'm excited to see Jose Contreras today. That's, that's--
Scott: That's why you got out of bed today.
LA: Outside of love of the game.

Scott: The Blue Jays have a new look this year. It's the new old look.

Scott: Even in batting practice, Hunter Pence is--
LA: Vicious.
Scott: And he's grunting with every swing.
LA: He's violent.
Scott: He's punishing the baseball.

LA: I got a problem.
...
Scott: If you weren't with us Friday, Larry was trying out a new automatic scorebook on his favorite mobile device. It lasted an inning and a half, before he pulled out pencil and paper.
LA: I got 'em both now. It's gonna take a while, okay?

LA: For you fans at spring training, stay close in front of the booth and you might get yourself a new iPad. This has a very good chance of getting tossed.
Scott: Somehow it's the machine's fault. Never the operator.
LA: And it's the application. Some people call 'em apps.

Scott: I don't think we've ever had Chris Segal as umpire. Well by the end, you can tell us what you think.
LA: I can tell you what I think right now. But I'm not going to, because I've changed my ways.

LA: Cole Hamels played in the Pro Am and overshot the green on a par 3. People were scattering. He said it was a little nerve-wracking.
Scott: Wheels was playing in it too.
LA: I could scatter some people.
Scott: You do that routinely, without a golf club in your hand.

LA: Why is the announcer so mad at Ben Francisco?
Scott: It's almost as if he has to yell so that everybody hears it.

Scott: Charlie throws the foul ball into the stands, where three men about Charlie's size begin to wrestle for it.

LA: The Mr. T starter set.
Scott: And the multicolored sunglasses.

LA: Or perhaps you can be like me and just buy apps and not even have any idea how they work.
Scott: You're an appaholic. Just say no, Larry.

Scott: Halladay gets a base hit and he's 1-for-1 on the year.
LA: Talk about starting off hot for the spring.

Scott: We've heard many pronunciations of Luis Montanez, so we asked him what his mom calls him. He said, "Baby."

Scott: Scott Beerer comes in to pinch run.
LA: Who?
Scott: Scott Beerer. It's B-e-e-r-e-r.
LA: I just don't like putting that extra "er" on the end of some names.

Scott: ...The accounts and descriptions of this game may not be disseminated without the expressed written consent of the Phillies.
LA: What happened before, when people were disseminating games?
Scott: I always thought you were sent to their houses to ask them to stop.

LA: Was yesterday St. Patrick's Day or something? Maybe today is. I think I turn green today.

Scott: Jet Blue Park is the first park we've seen that doesn't have ballgirls or ushers down the line to retrieve foul balls in play. It's a job for you if this doesn't work out.
LA: Not so sure I'd be able to handle it. I don't know how I'd look in Hooters shorts anyway.
Scott: Not sure if any of us want to find out.

+41:20
Scott: Here's a line drive to right. That should score another one. Watch for the guy with the ladder. And there's the dude with the ladder. He's gonna change the scoreboard from a three to a four.

LA: 25 pitches for Cole in the first inning, unofficially.
Scott: Are you counting pitches?
LA: Trying to.
Scott: You know, they'll tell us after he's done. If you want you can let somebody else do it. Take a load off.
LA: Well how many strikes and balls has he thrown at this point? 16 strikes, 11 balls.
Scott: That's information I just don't think you're gonna get anywhere else right now.

+1:04:30
Scott: And now it's 8-2. Here comes the guy with the ladder again.

+1:28:00
LA: I think it's mandatory that you have to play a four-hour game if you play any team from the American League East.

+1:45:00
Scott: Popped foul right behind the plate-- and right into the lap of Vik Dewan, president of the Philadelphia Zoo.

LA: I'm getting the hang of this scoring.

+1:49
Scott: You don't call them booths. They're beeth.
LA: The plural of tooth is teeth, and the plural of booth should be beeth. It only makes sense.
Scott: Like driving in a parkway and parking in a driveway.
LA: That's exactly right.

Scott: Just put him down as Joe in your automatic scorebook. He's just a placeholder. A back-of-the-book guy. Put him down as BOB -- back of the book.

LA: I think Hee's socks are longer than his pants. He must be really short.

LA: You gotta be on your toes in this booth.

+2:56:30
LA: Now's a good time to just sit and watch, and not worry about the scoresheet.

Scott: The biomechanics people believe that Tommy John surgery could be avoided if pitchers use different mechanics.
LA: What kind of mechanics? Throw underhand?

Scott: Experts think Steven Strasburg will get the same injury again, since he isn't changing his mechanics.
LA: Maybe he should stop throwing so hard.

Scott: Back with the totals and Larry's sterling commentary, right after this.

Scott: I have no idea.
LA: Sounds like somebody held up a bucket of chicken in front of Sarge!

Scott: There's been a lot of times in the last few years where I've seen you come close to actually breaking the equipment.
LA: Are you talking about when I took my fist and smashed my computer yesterday?
Scott: Right, it's that sort of reaction that leads me to believe you don't actually know what you're doing.
LA: You also realize I'm not very strong, because it didn't bother the comptuer at all.

0:33
Scott: So when you leaned over Sarge, and said, "Yeah, well what you need to do is, you--" I just had to leave the room. I couldn't even stand to watch that train wreck about to happen.

JJ: So did you enjoy Clearwater?
LA: It's the most beautiful spring I can remember there. I can't remember last year, but it's the best spring I can remember.
JJ: Ya know, I thought you said that last year, about this time.

LA: But they'd have a lot of fun!

0:16:57
Scott: Were you a Boy Scout?
LA: No. I wanted to be. I was having trouble with those badges. You had to win badges.
Scott: Didn't know how to tie knots and such? That's why you have nothing but slip-on and velcro shoes, right?

LA: What? Grip it and rip it?
Scott: No, load up.

LA: [Jimmy Rollins] might go yard here right here.
Scott: He might? That's a pretty definitive statement.
LA: We got static on the line. Can't get a clear signal for that long distance call.

LA: You know I've been waitin' for this.

Scott: Even maybe a boat-by.

Scott: We didn't even have to tape [your announcement card] to your forehead.

Scott: Mayberry, at 6' 6", he gets out there to the wall, he can just reach over and grab some nachos or something. It's only six feet high out there in left.

Scott: So Ruiz, who had the big spring, starts the season 2-for-2. He's hitting two thousand, Larry!

LA: I wish I had a better signal up here. I might try and make a long distance call for Shane Victorino. It's kinda gettin' interrupted. I'm not getting a clear line. Now we've got a caller! Calling long distance for Shane Victorino on this 3-1 pitch.

1:55:25
Scott: Are there people down there chanting Larry?
LA: That's what I thought. I guess they must still have adult beverage sales going on.
Scott: Or they shut 'em down and they know you might have extra.

Scott: Whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop!

1:34:28
LA: Halladay threw 92 [pitches] in his first outing. Did I say 92 or 72?
Scott: You said 92.
LA: If I didn't, that's what I meant. And if I did, that's also what I meant.

1:46:00
LA: I thought it was going to be a deep fly ball to left. [Shortstop] Rollins hardly moved.
Scott: That's why I try to use non-committal phrasing. "It's lifted in the air." How generic can that be?

2:16:55
LA: Leading off the inning, even if [Thome] gets on, he'll clog the bases a little.

2:19:00
Scott: Well [the Phillies] were without Jamie Moyer for a year, but they now have a player who wears the stirrup socks again -- Juan Pierre.
LA: Old school.

2:28:52
Scott: It's not exactly a hittin' clinic we're watching here the last two days.

(funny tone)
LA:: And it's easy to play [the Home Run Payoff by the Daily News], Scott.
Scott: Just look in the Daily News, Larry.

0:53:16
LA: Is he looking for Easter eggs out there?

1:02:30
Scott: Now wait a minute, now you would have loved to have .091 [batting average] a couple years I'm sure, right?
LA: Oh, no.
Scott: I figured anything above "O" would be good for you.

1:10:45
LA: He hit it just bad enough, [Alex Presley] said.
Scott: When he was asked whether it was the best worst hit he ever had, he said no, I've had worse.

1:38:40
LA: When [Vance Worley] got in trouble, he didn't get flustered, he didn't come out of his game.
Scott: Didn't get flusterated.
LA: Flusterated.

2:56:45
Scott: And time is called, as Bastardo goes ahead and delivers home.
LA: If you're gonna throw it, throw at the hitter. It's a pre-plunk.

3:28:45
Scott: PNC Park remains a house of horrors for the Phils.

Uncle Cholly: I think right now in Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania, baseball couldn't be more popular. I think everything about it's great.

0:01:05
Uncle Cholly: I like the smell of hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, beer, I like, ya know, I like barbecue.

1:02:08
LA: I'm a technological wizard.

1:06:08
Scott: Hamels, in fact, started his wind, and then stopped.
LA: Well he was about half-way to first base when the wind got done with him.

2:09:32
LA: They're not really hittin' the ball hard right yet.
Scott: Right yet?
LA: Right yet. That's because I know they're gonna hit soon.
Scott: They just haven't done it right yet.
LA: Right yet.

2:23:25
Scott: What era would you call that? Early twentieth century?
LA: Bonnie and Clyde. That's what it looked like. It looked like they came right from the movie.
Scott: It was Clyde, and Clyde, and Clyde, and Clyde, the way I saw it.
LA: Bonnie was late, okay?

x04-11-2012

1:12:40
LA: I really don't understand it that much.

1:21:05
LA: I couldn't tell if [the wind] was goin' out or in!
Scott: Cuz it was pointing right at ya. That's always the toughest one for the outfielder to judge.
LA: That's always the toughest for the broadcaster to judge, when the flag is pointing right at ya.

1:37:00
Scott: It's an avalanche!
LA: It is. It's a juggernaut.

1:47:40
Crowd: Fredd-y! Fredd-y! Fredd-y!
Scott: They don't know how to say his last name, but his first name, they got it right.

1:53:45
LA: It's done.
Scott: What do you mean, "It's done?"
LA: It's done. I don't know how to edit [the electronic scorecard].
Scott: Perhaps there's an online tutorial to help you.

1:57:35
LA: "Follow the Phillies with the MLB.com At Bat '12 app for your iPhone, iPad, iDroid-- Android--" That's what Sarge has. I think he has the iDroid.
Scott: He's not gonna start looking for the iDroid store, is he?

2:50:10
Scott: His ERA would be infinity.

2:54:35
LA: That guy's good at that.
Scott: He is really good at the walk-off hit-by-pitch.

9:00:00
Uncle Cholly: As long as you, uh, as long as you play pretty good and stuff like that, you're gonna-- you're gonna get a chance to play and everything. I mean, that's kinda how I look at it.

Scott: We're all set up for a three-hour, forty-seven-minute game.

0:44:48
LA: The right knee for the left-fielder, right? I mean, correct?
Scott: The left knee for the right-fielder.
LA: Correct.

0:46:25
LA: He didn't move his glove. That's just a botched call.

0:50:10
LA: "... live online and on your favorite devices in H-- HD-- HD quality. 
Scott: Whaddaya got there, pal?
LA: Just making sure it's not double high def quality. It's HD and not HHD.

0:59:00
Scott: A ruckus down below us. Smiley the Hatfield Pig is here.

1:10:05
LA: Why does this counter always shake at the start of the innings before I read something?
Scott: Cuz the Phanatic's running by with a pan-load of hot dogs.

1:21:20
Scott: And Larry Andersen will announce our next contestant in the Home Run Payoff inning. Who's he batting for Larry?
LA: Leon Schokiddinoger.
Scott: What was that name again?
LA: Leon Schokiddininoger. Him. He knows who he is, in Collingswood.

1:32:50
Random fan: T-Mac, can you sign my hat!
LA: I don't know why T-Mac just doesn't sign his hat.
Scott: I don't understand why Tom's dad doesn't ask him later on, like when he sees him tonight.

1:52:45
LA: They're not gonna-- he's not gonna throw a whole-- they're gonna-- not gonna force him outta the game-- not gonna get the bullpen early doin' a lot of first-pitch swinging.
Scott: What are you tryin' to say?
LA: Ya know.

2:34:40
LA: That's a really hard one to miss... That's well in fair territory.
...
Scott: In Bill Welke's defense, he's making that call at full speed.
LA: Bill Welke wasn't at full speed.

2:47:30
Scott: Double play and the ballgame's over. And the pitch, swung on, grounded toward short, Rollins up with it, feeds Galvis -- one -- relay to first -- in time, a double play, and the game is over!
LA: Nice call partner!

2:48:20
Scott: Phillies a three-to-one win tonight over the Florida Mar-- the Miami Marlins-- I did it! I finally did it! Game three, almost got outta here!
LA: So close!

Matt Stairs: They teach these guys from Maine how to play softball, yada yada, and they're talkin' crap, so I had to hit one into the night just to shut everybody up.

Matt Stairs: Here you try to hit the Budweiser sign, there you try to hit it over the light tower.

0:37:42
LA: Once the ball got out there he realized he was not gonna catch it.

0:59:20
Scott: Again, it goes 3-1-6-4 is the putout. And that's something you don't see every day.

1:12:40
LA: They're playing pepper, Victorino and Mayberry, with that pole down in left field, crushin' some balls.

1:19:40
Scott: Having problems with your app-s?
LA: It's pretty-- it's pretty, consistently... it's alright.
Scott: You want Sarge to take a look at it for ya?

1:26:20
LA: Is the book on Dickey to swing at the first pitch? Everybody?
Scott: I don't know. Who wrote the book on Dickey? Dickey writes books. Did he write the book? Ya know, they have Miguel Batista in the bullpen. They could have a little writing competition.
LA: He's on his, what, third book?

1:31:08
Scott: Gobble 'em up while you still can.

1:33:45
LA: That's not on my bucket list.
Scott: No? Mountain climbing?
LA: I struggle climin' out of bed, let alone climbin' up a mountain.

1:49:15
Scott: That thing came up and in. I though it mighta hit him. Did it?
LA: It mighta hit him, but he swung at it at the same time.
Scott: Probably wondering why he did that.

2:17:07
Scott: That's 101 pitches from R.A. Dickey, but he doesn't have an elbow ligament. What does it matter?
LA: It doesn't matter!

2:22:41
Scott: Without looking, can you spell Nieuwenhuis?
LA: Neu-- Nue-- New-- enhuis?
Scott: Nieu--

LA: He's not his personal catcher, but he's gonna catch every time Worley pitches.

0:56:55
LA: Basically just get a brain cramp error.
Scott: I don't think your scoring app has that -- the BCE?

1:15:20
LA: That ball should have been hit 600 feet, and he calls it a ball?

1:25:00
JJ: Got Gus Franzke here. Gus got the headsets on. He's ready. Looks like a future broadcaster.

1:44:14
LA: Bite my tongue.
JJ: Keep biting that tongue... Did it hurt, biting your tongue?
LA: Yes. It's killing me.

1:45:30
JJ: You're not biting your tongue.
LA: Compared to what I wanna to say...
JJ: That is true, that is true.

2:29:35
LA: You're not used to me [reading my advertisement] when I'm supposed to.
Scott: I actually-- I just didn't know you had one.
LA: I didn't either.
Scott: It wasn't taped to your forehead.

2:50:25
LA: A little jawing going on in the stands

2:50:43
LA: Doesn't expecting the unexpected make the unexpected expected?
Scott: My head hurts. What did you just say?
LA: I said doesn't expecting the unexpected make the unexpected expected?

Scott: Charlie's a big coin collector. He loves coins. Kinda like your philosophy: you can never have too much green.
LA: Can't have enough "coin."

LA: Don't you think you should eat your hot dog first?

LA: Just take the chair out from under me while I'm standing up.

1:41:00
Scott: There's a guy sitting in front of you in a Mets jersey that says "Apps." I wonder if Sarge thinks he owns the store.

0:34:50
LA: Giants have the worst fielding percentage.
Scott: Either that, or they have a really harsh scorekeeper.

0:37:20
LA: Nix scolded that ball. Or scalded it. He probably scolded it, too[, for not going high enough.]

0:40:25
Scott: Normally, the seagulls wait til it's over here at AT&T Park.
LA: Maybe they figure it's over cuz Halladay's pitching.

0:49:00
LA: What is going on in Melky Cabrera's mind? Is he thinking at all?

0:52:40
LA: I'm just about ready to have a word with Marty Foster.

0:58:55
Scott: How's your eyeball... Thought you might be allergic to garlic fries or sumthin'.

2:21:20
Scott: They forgot to build bullpens.

2:22:40
LA: That's a serious joke right there.

2:23:45
Scott: Larry, was it scalded or scolded?

2:23:55
LA: Where is that goofball?

Scott: They're gonna charge Crawford with another error.
LA: They don't like Crawford.

0:38:28
LA: The sooner you get behind, Scott, the more time you have to catch up...But it's probably best just to never get behind.
Scott: Probably is better.

0:47:55
LA: They're getting in his kitchen.

0:55:50
Scott: Ed Koskey, who probably has one of the better Crayola collections. He's from Easton.
LA: He loves those crayons.

LA: I need one of those extender grab arms.
Scott: The thing you use like for your golf ball.

Scott: <a>Churro</a>, Larry? You couldn't reach the cotton candy.

1:12:23
Scott: Larry is already trying to steal cotton candy.
LA: Get a little sugar rush.

LA: Go do your schtick!
Scott: Every word you say matters, Larry.
(1:22:06)
LA: The word was "schtick" just to be clear.

1:20:58
LA: Bumgardner is mad like crazy right now... He was upset.

Scott: You took your headphones off one ear. Off of your good ear.
LA: They're both good ears, just only one of them works.

Scott: Larry Andersen is cotton candy thief.

1:35:25

LA: Only the cotton candy would help.

He stinks.

LA: Hitting the ball [at AT&T Park] is like hitting a boulder.

LA: That ball should have been hit a mile.

2:44:05
LA: Crawford's shoes look like big pieces of Halloween candy.
Scott: Candy corn?

2:49:03
Scott: Pence has been known to run a little awkwardly.

2:58:15
Scott: Jim Jackson is back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Kinda like you, but you only do one sport.
LA: And that's questionable.

3:00:55
LA: It's like hitting a brick.
(combine with boulder quote earlier)

3:10:12
Scott: Nix, Orr, and Schneider all on the bench for the Phils.
LA: Who's "And Schneider"? Nix or "And Schneider"?
Scott: Nix, Orr, and Schneider. Who's Orr?

LA: I went into a toy store to find something for Gus. 

0:57:23
LA: I love Scott Franzke. I heart SF.

1:01:48
Scott: A guy in the first row ran like--
LA: Like Sarge!
Scott: Don't be so hard on the guy.

LA: His friends call him Joe. Excellent ballroom dancer.

1:24:05
Scott: There's the cotton candy guy, Larry.
LA: Too low. I need the taller guy.

1:40:15
Scott: Next contestant is Lucille Abrusi.
LA: I know a brewski.
Scott: You've known more than one.

0:44:25
LA: "TEVA respiratory asmus aware night..."
Scott: What the name of the night?
LA: Asthma awareness night?
Scott: I think you said asmus.

0:46:45
LA: Put the ball in play, and you have a chance. Did you know that?
Scott: Well, yeah. Another one of your pearls of wisdom. Like expecting the unexpected makes the unexpected expected.

0:48:05
LA: Phillies just haven't had a lot of success with pitchers going ten innings.

blog post: 15 shutout innings, chris shork?

1:07:10
Scott: It's hard to get these scores in since the game is going so fast. So I'm gonna do the Larry-Andersen-style scoreboard. The scores are ????
LA: And the teams are ???

1:16:45
Scott: Tonight could be a record-setter. Glad you made it, Larry.
LA: I wouldn't miss it for the world. Maybe for something else, but not for the world.

1:22:25
LA: Free glue!
Scott: Everybody loves it.

1:29:55
Scott: You're an excellent reader, Larry.

1:30:39
LA: We can see it with our peripheral vision. That's to the side, as Sarge would tell you.

2:07:00
LA: He was completely disinterested in getting that foul ball.
Scott: Waiting for the #1 tea box???

2:22:40
LA: Is it a kind of nod like, "I hear what you're saying, but I have no idea what you're saying"?
Scott: Yeah, kinda like the nods I get from you.

2:52:50
Worley: It was a mixture of sweat and the marine layer. They were steamin' up bad.

1:15:40
Scott: The Padres have been good at drawing walks.
LA: They've drawn pretty much more walks than fans. That might be an exaggeration.
Scott: For effect. Part of your <a>schtick</a>.

1:28:30
LA: That's a ridiculous call.
Scott: I believe they call is 2-unassisted.
LA: I call it an error on the umpire.

1:43:55
Scott: Did you know that Ty Wigginton's sister Lindsey was on Stanford's national runner-up Olympic synchronized swimming team in 2000?
LA: Duh.

1:44:15
LA: You never know what you'll find on the Padres scoreboard.

2:12:05
LA: Looked like he tried to hit it 14-15 miles.

2:56:40
LA: He might hit a home run here.
Scott: Might? He might strike out. He might ground to third.
[Editor's note: Victorino did homer in this at-bat, shortly after hitting a foul ball home-run distance, and getting hit by a pitch.]
[2:59:40]
LA: Gotta have a feel, Scott.

3:09:25
Scott: I'll be watching with my peripheral vision. I can see Sarge with my peripheral vision.
LA: He's gonna be mad you're using his word.

3:13:05
Scott: All the cords ended up on the floor somehow. I'll blame the two-year-old for that.
LA: What'd I do?
Scott: The other one, who was here tonight.

LA: It's the marine layer.
Scott: How do we know that? Do we need further schooling?
LA: Just trust me.

0:52:38
LA: The ball caught a nice fan down there.

1:35:30
LA: Another opening day tomorrow. Military opening day.
Scott: So we had  opening day,  opening day,  opening night,  opening day...

1:36:58
LA: Guy can flat out rake.

1:39:50
Scott: Bob Davidson watching closely.
LA: Waiting to call a balk.

Scott: No wonder you have no game notes left. You've been making paper airplanes.

1:52:10
LA: I never take a day off.
Scott: No, Larry, you're pretty much workin' all the time. You're always workin' on sumthin'. I'm not always sure what it is.
LA: Nor am I.

2:24:45
LA: This is not a lineup that is gonna put fear into any pitcher.

2:39:05
LA: That's uncalled for.

2:39:55
LA: This is ugly.

--------------------------

0:41:20
Scott: Is this the marine layer? Or is this fog?
LA: It's the marine layer. It's a combination of marine layer and fog.

0:42:10
LA: They've been pretty well camouflaged at the plate. Disguised as hitters.

1:37:25
LA: Did I say it's not going well? It's not going well.

1:39:40
Scott: You don't even know his name. You just call him "that guy."

1:54:45
LA: It's about time for a birthday cupcake. Happy birthday, Gus!

2:00:30
LA: It's also the cupcake inning.

2:00:50
Scott: If I had a Twitter account, I'd use it to share photos of you stuffing your mouth with cupcakes. There are cupcake shavings all over this booth.

2:01:40
LA: The unexpected is becoming expected.

2:05:10
Scott: I noticed you scattered cupcake all over the floor.
LA: Hey, bugs like to eat, too, ya know.

----------------------------

04-23-2012

0:36:40
LA: I'm waiting with baited breath. Whatever that means.

0:41:17
Scott: Mixing the warm air outside and the air conditioning in the booth, it's a perfect night for baseball

0:48:50
Scott: Since we're out west, we inherently have more time [to catch up].
LA: The only problem is that they stop you after nine innings if the score is not tied.

0:57:40
LA: You flew over the Grand Canyon. You were probably a little a-scared.
Scott: I was a little a-scared. It's true.

0:58:45
Scott: It's fascinating. We should do that tomorrow.
LA: Fascinate?

1:31:10
Scott: The few Phillies fans here trying to start a "Let's go Flyers" chant.

1:38:40
Scott: Is [Pat Burrell using] an automated scorebook?
LA: No, he's not ready for that yet.
Scott: I'm sure when he's ready, he'll go to Sarge for help.

1:57:25
Scott: I think it's time you go check out the dessert cart.
LA: Lookin' at that Fat Burger sign.

Scott: Larry, I'm just impressed you're paying attention at this point.

2:39:15
Scott: Through every dark cloud, you are a ray of sunshine.
LA: Glass is always half full.
Scott: No glass has ever been half full near you.

2:47:03
LA: Which brings me to my next question: how do you know if a word is misspelled in the dictionary?

2:55:15
Scott: He was a Yale graduate.
LA: I will never be on that list.

LA: I usually threw my hatchets about three-quarters and that's why--.
Scott: You got more ground balls with your hatchets.
LA: They cut, yeah. They did cut, yes.

0:49:54
LA: That's when you know you're not-- you're not doing well, is when a guy with kidney stones is playin' ahead of ya.

1:04:10
LA: I was looking at a billboard on the screen behind the plate. I thought was Teameyedoc. All the letters were together, and then I realized it was Team Eye Doc. I was like, "What is Teameyedoc?"
Scott: They don't call you the brightest analyst in the league, right?

1:16:40
LA: I guess you gotta have a feel, huh?

1:34:10
LA: "Teva respiratory asmus aware-- asthma awareness night..." I can't say asthma and awareness together.

2:00:55
LA: I know when to say when.

2:22:21
LA: [Cough]
Scott: How's that cough button working out? 
LA: It's-- better now.
Scott: It's better when you push it. It works better that way.
LA: I'm having problems with cough buttons this year.

2:23:34
LA: This is a game of superstitions.

2:28:15
Scott: Did you get that attendance?
LA: Yes. 24,213.
Scott: I wonder how many of them have had tacos.

2:42:27
LA: Does it look like he's in pretty good shape?
Scott: He's... he's Mike Zagurski.
LA: He is Mike Zagurski.

LA: I don't know how to tell them to appeal it... Appeal it!! Think that worked?
Scott: I don't think so. I don't think anybody heard you, but maybe if you stand up and waive your arms and flap 'em like a bird, Hamels will notice you. You are wearing a brightly-colored shirt.

0:40:05
Scott: Too bad you didn't have your big "Appeal it" sign you could have hung it out the window.
LA: Really?

0:47:18
LA: Sarge better put some floaties on. He's out by the <a>pool</a> with Greg Murphy.

0:49:20
LA: Took a step, and kinda bumped into a lady and stepped back, and said "Excuse me," and she proceeded to-- "bomb it" on him. I don't know, or regurgitate.
Scott: You've already said it. There's no need to come up with a new word.

1:14:05
Scott: We saw Breslow, the smartest man in baseball.
LA: We don't have a lot in common, do we?
Scott: No.

1:19:58
LA: "You can tailgate at the pent... tailgate in the Phillies party tent..." I read that alright.
Scott: I don't know. I think we might wanna to rewind it. Did you say "tailgate at the pent"?
LA: I might have.

1:42:55
LA: Zagurski, built for comfort, not for speed.

2:08:25
LA: I always shop local, as to where I am.

2:12:40
Scott: Get one more [Z-name] and it'll be a three-pack of the Z-pack.

2:14:55
Scott: Stop the game! The radio guy has something to say!

2:18:40
Scott: Erased trying to steal third base, in your very-typical 1-5-1-4-6-3 caught stealing.

2:35:21
LA: The Phils put on their hittin' shoes.

2:43:26
Scott: We have a plethora of snacks here in the booth.
LA: They're rally snacks!
Scott: Thanks to the Gus man.
LA: Hope he doesn't get mad at me. I'm eatin' his Goldfish.
Scott: I'm supposed to bring 'em home.

Uncle Cholly: That's baseball, and that's just the way it goes. People don't understand that. I happen to think I do.

0:55:45
LA: If you're not hitting the ball a lot, and you're giving up some runs, you're probably not gonna win a lot of games.

1:33:40
LA: [stuttering with the read] I was tryin' to read and see if I was reading the words right as I'm reading it.

1:54:00
Scott: Hey Larry! (That's you.)
LA: Hey!
Scott: It's the inning. The one you've been waiting for.

2:27:02
LA: That's what relieving is all about -- the vulture.

2:28:55
Scott: Just shout it out, Larry. What do you gotta say?
LA: Stop it!

2:30:08
Scott: You're getting your signs out, I see. Does that help you get it off your chest without having to yell it out to the field?
LA: No, it's not the same.

2:38:25
Scott: Big arm, but [Dolese] doesn't always know where it's going. 10 1/3 innnings, 8 walks.

2:54:55
LA: You just wait'll it warms up a little bit.
Scott: And?
LA: You won't be cold.

LA: I'll tell ya what, [Chooch] is a tough hambre behind the plate.

2:18:07
LA: Ya know, there's been a lot of talk about doin' something with the walls in here. Did they ever consider just like rubber padding?
Scott: A lock on the door? That locks from the outside?

2:21:40
Scott: If the Phillies win tonight, do we have to go get tacos?
LA: Yes, absolutely!

3:10:44
LA: That was just plain cheese at the knees.

Wheels: What makes Chooch a good hitter?
Cholly: He has a good load...

0:43:20
Scott: Polanco is two hits shy of 2000 for his career.
LA: I think he'll get those, barring injury.
Scott: Crowded on that limb?

0:54:45
LA: Josh Hamilton is alien hot.

1:02:00
Scott: Mayberry slides in for a stand-up double. Of course, it can't be a stand-up double if he slides in.
1:02:25
LA: Whoever that is out there. Forgot to change it.
Scott: We're having a pretty good inning so far.

1:36:05
JJ: We know .200 is the Mendoza line, .100 is the interstate, what would below .100 be?
LA: Outerstate.

1:54:30
LA: I will never disseminate.
JJ: What exactly?
LA: I won't do it. Whatever that means... One day, I might decide to do it, just to throw some people off.

2:16:15
LA: The [Iron] Pigs were playing on the road!

Scott: The game's not played on paper, Larry.

1:03:35
Scott: That ball wasn't even hit hard.
LA: He got a-scared.

1:11:05
LA: With nary a raindrop.
Scott: Nary a raindrop. You got it, pal.

1:11:55
LA: You know fans all over the Internet are clamoring for a Marwin Gonzalez home-run ball.
Scott: Are they clamoring?

2:12:30
LA: How many times has Sarge told you not to talk with your mouth full?

2:20:10
LA: Grab the MLB At-Bat 2012 app for your iPhone, iPad, Sarge's iDroid, Android...
Scott: I don't think they want to to just start making stuff up.

2:32:30
Scott: [The Elias Sports Bureau] can find out anything, Larry... They can bring you food and tell you how many other Andersen's are here.
LA: And with an "en."

LA: It never seems to be comfortable [at Wrigley Field].

Scott: What is that?
LA: It's my meal money. My lunch money! Found it in my jacket.
Scott: That's one of those old thousand dollar bills.
LA: Expensive lunch around here.

LA: One area LaHair is struggling is pinch hitting. He's 0-for-1.

LA: [Garza] is slow, slower, and slowest.

LA: If that one's low and the previous one was high, I don't know where the strike zone is.

LA: No.

LA: It's easy, easy, easy to play Scott.
