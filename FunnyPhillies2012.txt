LA: Maybe a worm hoagie.

JJ: How was golf today, LA?
LA: A little breezy after the tenth hole. Had a wardrobe malfunction... Something I don't think a seamstress could even repair... Don't bend over on the golf course.
JJ: Before we get in trouble, let's change the subject.

Scott: I guess so.

Scott: The Brewers can play defense however they want, but--
LA: They're just not smart.


LA: They must not have the MLB At Bat 2012 app to find out Howard had achilles tendon surgery and can't run very well. They're holding him on at first base.


LA: Juan Pierre is a little bit faster than Howard. He said facetiously.


Scott: It goes without say, but the Phillies don't have much speed on the bases right now.
LA: They got some base-cloggers.


LA: Scott, you just can't beat fun at the ol' ballyard.


Scott: Aoki's shin guard flew off on his way to first, and I thought he was literally blowing a tire! Rubber shreds flying every which way.


Scott: Joe Gains has a very scientific way of picking the winner of the [Miller Field] sausage race. He just picks Polish every time.


Scott: I wouldn't have corrected you, but, ya know...
LA: I know exactly what it is. It's all about accuracy.

LA: Homer Bailey is 225 pounds. That's only five pounds more than Sarge-- what's that look for, Sarge?


Scott: In case you couldn't tell from the boos, Scott Rolen is up to bat.
LA: I don't understand it.
Scott: That's nothing new.


LA: I felt bad for Sarge.
Scott: No you didn't. Not for a second.


Scott: You rarely feel bad for Sarge.
LA: I did the other day on the golf course.
Scott: I feared for his health.


LA: That was one of the most humid days I can remember in my life. And that goes back to last week.
Scott: As far as you can remember?
LA: Yup.


LA: That's what I said -- a business bank citizen's person special.


LA: It's a beautiful night tonight. Not a cloud in the sky that we can see here. Of course it's dark, though.


-------------------------------------


x08-22-2012


Scott: For tonight's 90s retro night, the Reds are wearing the wide, striped elastic waistbands.
LA: That's for the guys who are somewhat physically challenged around the waistline. 220, 222 right around there. [link to previous Sarge weight quote]


Scott: The Phillies have given up as many home runs in the eighth as they have in the fourth, but obviously the eighth inning is a more critical juncture.


Scott: I have some good news for you. [Closer] Aroldis Chapman is not warming up yet.
LA: Bad news is [starter] Arroyo hasn't hit the showers yet.


LA: When you go in there against Chapman, you have to gear up.


postgame
JJ: The eighth inning has become something of a Bermuda Triangle for the Phils.


-------------------------------------


x08-23-2012


LA: I'm allergic to rain.


LA: It stopped raining. Or is it invisimist? Yup, it's invisimist. With binoculars, looking into the lights, you can see it.


LA: The Mets are reeling. At least the Phils have realt all year long.
Scott: Is that a new word?
LA: Just made it up.
Scott: Won't last long.


Scott: Cash Horst is the second child named Cash by Phillies relievers that I can recall. Wasn't there another one?
LA: No, that's just what we call you: Big Glue.


Scott: Everybody's a little bit tired in this fourth hour of the game.
LA: I know I am.
Scott: And you haven't done anything.


Scott: If the Reds get out of this bases-loaded, no-out jam in the eleventh--
LA: I'm going home.
Scott: [Manager] Dusty Baker better make a stop in Atlantic City on his way back to Cincinnati.

bottom 4
JJ: The Phillies have an off-day on Monday after 17 straight games.
LA: Much-needed.
JJ: Are you speaking on behalf of the players or yourself?
LA: Me, of course! The players have it easy.


LA: The plate does have an inside corner.


LA: Gonzalez will be up due third next inning.
Scott: What does that mean, exactly?


Scott: The Nationals have re-signed Chad Tracy through next year.
LA: They love him on the bench -- they love the way he sits there.


top 7
LA: Bryce Harper ranks seventh among rookies with a 2.42 range factor. Who makes this garbage up???!!! They just give guys like me something to complain about! Somebody's got too much time on their hands, and somebody else is listenin'! Who found that? Where do you go to find that stuff?


bottom 7
Scott: We can go to the cloud and get all the info you need about range factor.


top 8
LA: Range factor is something new for arbitration which nobody knows anything about.


LA: Range factor is just another useless stat that most people have never heard of.
Scott: You lead all major league announcers in BSB: Baseball Stats Bitterness.


-------------------------------------


x08-28-2012


LA: “Start practicing your fake cough so you can get out of work and attend the Citizens Bank businessperson's special.”


LA: They probably don't want to use Josh Thole to pinch hit. He's 0-for-18... 0-for-21, I'm sorry.
Scott: He's getting worse!
LA: And he didn't even do anything.


bottom 9
LA: This has become such a pull-happy team.


-------------------------------------


x08-29-2012


top 3
Scott: Jerry Lane was pointing to the sky with that strike call. As if to say, “I'm number one!”
LA: Well... nevermind. I don't wanna get in trouble.
Scott: Oh, now you say that.


-------------------------------------


x08-30-2012


LA: It's not often when a ball bounces over your head in both directions.


-------------------------------------

top 2
LA: We've got smart listeners -- the smartest in baseball
Scott: But we don't have the smartest broadcasters. The fans are smart enough to know we're not the smartest.


LA: When Howard leads off an inning with a walk or a single, it's almost like a rally killer. You need three hits to score him.


top 4
LA: The umpires don't have any idea what they were doing out there, which doesn't surprise me in the least.
Scott: That was a ridiculously botched call.
LA: They might have to go to replay on everything and do away with umpires altogether.
...
Scott: I gotta tell ya, that play was so messed up. The baserunners were confused. So were the broadcasters.
LA: So were the umpires.


top 5
LA: “Go to Phillies dot com splash-- slash events.”


bottom 5
Scott: The game's been around for a long time.
LA: Longer than Wheels even.


Scott: Let's go to the cloud, Larry!


LA: It's only the bottom of the fifth. I wonder how many more plays the umpires can foul up in this game?


-------------------------------------
x09-07-2012


LA: How can you get turf toe if you don't play on turf?
Scott: You mean Astroturf? Grass is still turf.
LA: It would be sod toe.
Scott: Sod toe? Got me a bad case of the sod toe. It's a little different than having a green thumb.


LA: One thing that would help Jake Diekmann would be someone teaching him how to be in the set position without being a contortionist.

top 4
LA: You're only young once, but you can be immature forever.


bottom 4
JJ: Mayberry beats a ground ball foul.
LA: The wind really knocked that one down.


top 8
Scott: The bat went flying toward a cameraman, but it looks like the camera took the brunt of the force.
LA: Better the camera than the squash.


LA: I got distracted.
Scott: What else is new? LOOK! A SQUIRREL!


Scott: Your attention span has waned a time or two.


-------------------------------------
x09-11-2012


bottom 1
Scott: Ya gotta be able to throw hard if you come out of Alvin, Texas. (Nolan Ryan)


LA: Nolan Ryan was the only guy to approach the manager and say, “Skipper, can you keep Larry Andersen out of my games from now on.”
Scott: If I were him, I would have taken action as well.


Scott: That's dynamite analysis, Larry.


Scott: The fan on the field got ejected, and now he'll have to listen to the rest of the game on the radio. Talk about punishment.


top 2
LA: What was in that Kool-Ade?


top 7
LA: Get the resuscitator out.


bottom 7
Scott: You and Sarge are running the IT department here.


Scott: Mike dunn has given up three walks and a sac fly this inning. I'm thinkin' this isn't what Abner Doubleday intended.


end
LA: The wild card is a long-shot, but drink your Kool-Ade and keep your fingers crossed.


-------------------------------------
x09-12-2012


LA: The Phanatic's found a seat in the front row.
Scott: He's found a seat on someone in the front row.
LA: Dumpin' popcorn on everybody. He's annoying.


top 7
Scott: John Buck is one who can hide out in the weeds and then hit one out on ya.


Scott: Just before that home run, my partner pointed to the right-field seats.
LA: Ya gotta have a feel.
Scott: How do you do it?
LA: Baseball instincts.


Scott: LA is busy playing the bongo cam.
LA: I can do it all!
Scott: You can play the bongos, predict home runs, and leap tall buildings in a single bound.


-----------------------------------
x09-13-2012


top 1
LA: Quite frankly, the Astros are not a real good team.


bottom 1
LA: If you're gonna have a conversation here at the game, make sure you whisper, because everybody will hear it.
Scott: There are many people here. I'm not sure if there are thousands here.


Scott: The Astros are interviewing for a new manager. Would you be interested in managing this club?
LA: No.


top 6
Scott: The Rangers have some mashers who can do some damage in Minute Maid Park.


Scott: Wesley Wright has pitched 45.1 innings in 68 appearances.
LA: He's overworked.
Scott: Aren't we all?


Scott: Aumont is pitching to a crowd with less energy here than he was at Citizens Bank Park. You really gotta keep after it to realize there's even a ballgame going on down there.


------------------------------------


x09-14-2012


Scott: Utley never swings at that 3-0 fastball. I wonder if he'll ever “lion-in-the-weeds” and just ambush it once.


Scott: Ya know how Arizona has a dirt path from home plate to the pitcher's mound? Houston should have one from the dugout to the mound.
LA: From the bullpen to the mound!


LA: This year might be one of the toughest paper routes in Houston's history.


------------------------------------
x09-15-2012


LA: Sarge is giving me false information.


LA: If I tape the crowd noise, it'll help me sleep at night.
Scott: It's kind of a subtle white noise.


LA: The stars at night are big and bright in Washington, too. They just didn't make a song about it.
Scott: Well it's also about the prairie sky being high and wide.
LA: Yeah, we don't have that.

top 2
LA: Thought I might have to play that foul ball toward us.
Scott: Glad you didn't. Wouldn't want you to have to embarrass yourself.


LA: Charlie likes the way Dom Brown pulls the ball. I like the way he goes the other way.
Scott: I like the way he can please both of you. Keep everybody happy.
LA: I've even heard you say that you like the way he goes up the middle.


Scott: Don't start with me. Two more weeks...
LA: And you can pick your own friends!


LA: Ruiz was just showing [home plate umpire] some professional courtesy.
Scott: Maybe someday we'll have that in the booth.


Scott: I don't anticipate you'll be here forever.
LA: If someone had their way, I might not be here now... Gus would miss me.
Scott: That's a short list, but he's on it.


LA: That autograph from Kevin Gregg would fit nicely on my shelf of shame. Right below my wall of fame.


Scott: Hamels has a hitter's count now, Larry.
LA: He's gonna look to turn and burn.

Sarge: I do.

JJ: Ground ball to Rollins. It's a worm burner.

x09-25-2012


LA: I'll have you know I worked out today.
Scott: You worked out before game #15 and game #154.
LA: Don't wanna over-do it. Baby steps. Next year, I'll work out three times.


Scott: What does your workout consist of?
LA: Just gettin' out of bed! That's my warmup.
Scott: Then drinking coffee?
LA: Yup, that gets my heartrate goin'.


Scott: So you really work out?
LA: Yeah.
Scott: Is that why you didn't have cake here in the booth?
LA: Yup. I had thirty cookies instead.


bottom 3
LA: Darin Ruf's silent treatment after that home run was the longest I've ever seen. Aside from the silent treatment you game me when we first started working together.
Scott: There's a lot of days I still don't wanna talk to you.


LA: I had a briefcase full of over 200 pieces of sugar-free gum.


-------------------------------------
x09-26-2012


Scott: Ryan Howard was none too pleased when he was hit in his last at-bat.


JJ: For a while there, Ryan Zimmerman was throwing submarine-style, almost as if he had the yips.


LA: I didn't even go to the cloud for that info.
Scott: That's what we'll be doing tomorrow night.
LA: Going to the cloud?
Scott: Going to the Cloyd!

x09-28-2012


top 1
Scott: I'm not sure if that ball hit Mayberry on the shoulder when he dove.
LA: He may have over-dove.


LA: My math is all coming back to me.


LA: I don't remember Michael Martinez playing centerfield last year. Then again, I don't remember last week.


LA: This is actually a larger crowd than I thought it would be.
Scott: This game is not suffering from massive <a>disinterest</a>.


Scott: Mark Buehrle is batting .046. As a hitter, he's a real good pitcher.


LA: Not a lot of offense in this scoreless game.
Scott: You are the best in the business.
LA: A casual observer probably wouldn't even notice that.


-------------------------------------
x09-30-2012


LA: All I've been doing today is running around getting things for people.


Scott: At game #159, you're still sharp as a tack.

top 4
LA: Notice I went to the cloud on my own this time?
Scott: Your proficiency is astounding.
LA: Although my daughter told me today that technology has surpassed me.
Scott: And this was a news flash? Probably because you still have “3G”.


------------------------------------
x10-02-2012


Scott: Larry, do you have any keys to this game?
LA: Get it in.


bottom 2
Scott: Sarge was rockin' the Pandora earlier tonight.
LA: He said if I had time, he'd show me how to use it.


Scott: I'm on the cutting edge. It's a dull edge.


LA: I like music, but I'm not big on it. If the Temptations didn't sing it, I probably don't know it.


top 3
Scott: B.J. Rosenberg is 1-for-1 in the big leagues, with his only hit coming off the Nationals.
LA: He finds the Nationals pitching to his liking.


bottom 3
Scott: That's a 3-2-5-2-3 putout the run-down, if you're scoring at home.
LA: Another chance to put RD in my scorebook.
Scott: RD?
LA: Run-down.


Scott: Did you push a wrong button again and it just happened to work?


Scott: By 5:00 tomorrow, I'm pretty sure we're done talking for the year.[ I'm just kiddin' pal, you can call me anytime, anyday!]
LA: You just won't answer.


top 8
Scott: Okay, smart guy. Can't wait til this season's over.


Scott: Whoever was sitting on the bench in the bullpen had a chance to take Darin Ruf's homer in the breadbasket.


------------------------------------
x10-03-2012


Scott: The Phillies' current sellout streak of 1 is longer than the playoff-bound Nationals.


LA: Pretty soon you'll be home and Gus can help you work on your eating and drinking habits. I might stop by for some help too.


Scott: In the last four games against the Phillies, it's Nationals 11, Darin Ruf 8.


bottom 4
LA: On the train ride home from here, I think I'll start converting to my winter friends list.
Scott: Don't need much more than a Post-It note for that, right?
LA: Yeah, but I write real small.
Scott: Perhaps the back of a business card?
